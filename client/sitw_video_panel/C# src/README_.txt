iSpy source and executable is licenced under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) v3. This is a "permissive" (non-copyleft) Open Source license that guarantees the freedoms to use, modify, and redistribute, but that permits proprietary (non-open-source) derivative works. 

iSpy uses adapted open source code from the following projects:
AForge.net
Accord.net
NAudio
FFMPEG
Flowplayer
nVLC

Written in C# and built in Visual Studio.

The 'Screens in the Wild' version version of iSpy, provides a video panel with fixed dimensions (both overall panel and individual streams) for four video streams. The screen position (along the bottom of a portrait screen) is also hard-coded.

The intention is that users should not be able to close or resize the panel, providing a continous video link.

It is also set to always run on top of other Windows apps.

Changes to video stream configuration require using the unmodified version of iSpy (see Sitw User Guide: https://github.com/screensinthewild/sitw_network_user_guide/).
