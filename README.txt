DESCRIPTION

The core components for a network of public-facing, urban screens. Styled for portrait, touch-based display @ a resolution of 745x1340. 

The database allows separate slideshows from the same media directory, using a database 'appName' field to filter the images. 

As this version of the ScreenBase Slideshow is instantiated, for each application/slideshow you will need to make a copy of all project files and then customise the settings and styling.

More information may be found in the sub-directory for each component.

For useage and configuration, refer to the sitw_network_user_guide.
